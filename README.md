## Spring Boot Slash Command Webhook Server

This project is intended to be like a small "Hello World" implementation of Discord's
[Slash Commands and Interactions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands)
mostly for me to figure out before integrating these into another project I am currently working on.

Most of this in the current state is still me learning Spring Boot and also just trying to figure out everything else.
So don't expect the cleanest code it, still it should give a good idea for people who were struggling like me.

**THIS PROJECT IS STILL HEAVILY WIP**
